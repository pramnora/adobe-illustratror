## Introduction

My first introduction to using Adobe Illustrator 'graphic' software...;  
was when I took a course at WMCollege, Mornington Crescent branch, called:   
**ALS/Additional Learning Support: Creative Computing**  
which was being given inside of room: 513/10 AM - 12:30 PM/(10 weeks course).     

- https://github.com/pramnora/creative-computing/edit/main/README.md  

I found it really very interesting, and, even, exciting to use...;  
in that I was totally unfamiliar with having used such graphic software before.  

Also, when I checked out seeing a few YouTube tutorials...;  
I was amazed at the endless number of effects it's possible to produce.

## Using Adobe Illustrator: Saving files

After class, I went downstairs to visit the computer room...where I continued studying.
-(NOTE: The computers downstairs also have Adobe Illustrator software available to continue working on.)-

I discovered that Abobe Illustrator files can be saved using multiple different formats, including:-

-- [.ai] The native Adobe Illustrator format file (this means you can open it/and, continue editing that same file)
-- [.pdf] Adobe portable document format file
-- [.svg]/ Scaleable Vector file
-- and, more...

Too, I wanted to play around at learning to use Adobe Illustrator Menus/tools...find out what they do/and, also, how they do it...?
