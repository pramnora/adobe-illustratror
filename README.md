## Introduction

My first introduction to using Adobe Illustrator 'graphic' software...;  
was when I took a course at WMCollege, Mornington Crescent branch, called:   
**ALS/Additional Learing Support: Creative Computing**  
which was being given inside of room: 513/10 AM - 12:30 PM.   

- https://github.com/pramnora/creative-computing/edit/main/README.md  

I found it really very interesting, and, even, exciting to use...;  
in that I was totally unfamiliar with having used such software before.  

Also, when I checked out seeing a few YouTube tutorials...;  
I was amazed at the endless number of effects it's possible to produce.
